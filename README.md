Header files of note:
---------------------
view/inc/MyDefines.h   <-- contains enums
utils/inc/UnitTest.h   <-- contains TEST macro


Test classes:
-------------
controller/src/Test.cpp


Most of the program's logic is in the ChessBoard class:
-------------------------------------------------------
model/inc/ChessBoard.h
model/src/ChessBoard.cpp



*Note: These files are some I salvaged from my BYU account, and it seems like it isn't the complete version.
